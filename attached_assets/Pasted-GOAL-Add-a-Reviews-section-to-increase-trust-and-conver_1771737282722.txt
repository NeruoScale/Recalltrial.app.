GOAL
========================================
Add a Reviews section to increase trust and conversions, and optionally collect reviews from users inside the app. Reviews shown publicly must be admin-approved.

========================================
REQUIREMENTS (MVP = MUST DO)
========================================

A) Database Model (SQLite via SQLAlchemy)
Create a Review model/table with fields:
- id (int, PK)
- created_at (datetime, default now)
- rating (int, 1..5, required)
- text (string/text, required, max ~300 chars)
- name (string, optional, max ~60)
- location (string, optional, max ~60)
- source (string, default "manual")  # manual / in_app / import
- is_approved (bool, default False)
- is_featured (bool, default False)

Add migration/init-db support:
- If project has an init-db command, ensure Review table is created there too.
- If no migration system exists, use db.create_all() path consistent with the app.

B) Public Reviews Section (Landing Page)
1) Add a “Reviews” section on the main landing page (or the most marketing-facing page).
2) Show only approved reviews:
   - Display as modern cards: stars, review text, name/location (if provided).
   - Show 6 reviews max by default; if more exist, show a “View more” button that expands or links to /reviews.
3) Add a small trust line like:
   - “Trusted by people who hate surprise renewals.”
4) Provide a fallback if no reviews exist yet:
   - show 3–6 placeholder reviews stored in code OR seed a few in init-db as approved.

C) Public Reviews Page
Create route:
- GET /reviews
Show all approved reviews with pagination or simple “load more” (keep it simple).

D) Admin Moderation (MVP must have)
Create a hidden admin page to manage reviews:
- GET /admin/reviews
- List all reviews (approved + pending)
- Actions:
  - Approve
  - Reject/Delete
  - Toggle featured
- Basic protection:
  - Use a simple ADMIN_PIN or ADMIN_SECRET env var check, or reuse existing session auth if the app already has admin login.
  - Do NOT leave /admin open.
Add CSRF protection to admin actions if CSRF exists in the app; otherwise implement minimal CSRF for admin forms.

========================================
OPTIONAL (DO IF EASY, BUT NOT REQUIRED)
========================================

E) In-app Review Submission
1) Add a “Leave a Review” button in the app UI (e.g., settings/footer).
2) Route:
- GET /review/new  -> form (rating, text, name optional, location optional)
- POST /review/new -> create Review row with is_approved=False, source="in_app"
3) After submit:
- show success message: “Thanks! Your review will appear after approval.”

Validation rules:
- rating must be 1–5
- text required (min 10 chars), max 300
- sanitize/strip HTML (store plain text)
- simple spam guard: basic rate limit using session (e.g., max 2 submissions/day per session)

========================================
UI / DESIGN
========================================
- Keep it modern: clean spacing, rounded cards, subtle shadow, responsive grid.
- Match the existing app style (colors/fonts).
- Add star rendering (★★★★★) based on rating.
- Ensure good mobile layout.

========================================
DELIVERABLES
========================================
1) List files changed (backend + templates + css/js).
2) Confirm how admin protection works and which env var is required.
3) Provide the exact URLs:
   - Public landing section location
   - /reviews
   - /admin/reviews
   - /review/new (if implemented)
4) Run a quick smoke test:
   - Seed review shows on landing
   - Submitting review creates pending record
   - Admin approve makes it visible publicly
   - Delete works

========================================
CONSTRAINTS
========================================
- Do not add heavy dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- Keep code consistent with existing patterns in the project.
- Ensure public pages never show unapproved reviews.
Start by searching the current templates to find the landing page and where to insert the section.
