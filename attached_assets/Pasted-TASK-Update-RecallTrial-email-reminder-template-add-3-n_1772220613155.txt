TASK: Update RecallTrial email reminder template + add 3 new testimonials to the site.

PART 1 — Email Reminder Update

We recently updated reminder logic to:
- End date must be at least 4 days from today
- Send reminders:
   • 3 days before
   • 2 days before
   • 1 day before
- Never schedule or display reminders in the past

Please update the email reminder template accordingly.

GOALS:
1) Email subject format:
   “[RecallTrial] {{serviceName}} renews in {{X}} day(s)”

   Example:
   “[RecallTrial] Netflix renews in 2 days”

2) Email body must include:
   - Clear service name
   - Renewal date (formatted human readable, e.g., Mar 4, 2026 at 11:59 PM)
   - How many days remaining (3 / 2 / 1)
   - Renewal price (if available)
   - Cancel link button (primary CTA)
   - Soft reassurance line about privacy

3) Updated email structure:

HEADER:
Reminder: {{serviceName}} renews in {{X}} day(s)

BODY:
Your {{serviceName}} subscription renews on:
{{formattedEndDate}}

Renewal amount: {{price}} {{currency}} (if available)

If you don’t want to be charged, cancel before this date.

[Cancel Subscription] → {{cancelUrl}}

FOOTER:
You’re receiving this because you added this trial to RecallTrial.
We never access your inbox without your permission.

4) Ensure:
- Days remaining is dynamically calculated.
- No reminder email is ever sent if scheduled time is in the past.
- Timezone respects user’s saved timezone.
- Email HTML looks clean and minimal (no heavy marketing style).

PART 2 — Add 3 New Testimonials

Add 3 new testimonials to the Testimonials section.

Do not change design layout.
Just append them to the existing testimonials array or component.

Testimonials must feel realistic and short.

Add:

1)
Name: Daniel K.
Text:
“I didn’t realize how much I was losing from forgotten trials until I started tracking them. This saved me more than I expected.”

2)
Name: Sarah M.
Text:
“I used to screenshot trial dates and still forget. Getting reminders 3, 2, and 1 day before renewal changed everything.”

3)
Name: Ahmed R.
Text:
“The cancel link in the reminder email is the best part. No searching, no stress.”

Ensure:
- They render correctly in production (not only Replit preview).
- They appear on homepage and pricing page if testimonials section exists there.
- No dev-only flags hide them.

DELIVERABLE:
- Confirm email template updated.
- Confirm reminder logic aligned with 3/2/1 day rule.
- Confirm testimonials visible on deployed public URL.
